This repo contains JavaScript Homework 14 - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation.  Both the UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2 challenges have been completed and submitted.

UFO-level-1 is located in https://github.com/jhurley684/javascript_challenge/edit/main/ufo-level-1/  directory.  This directory contains the app.js with my javascript code, the index.html and data.js files.  The html code is essentially the same as the starter code provided.  The app.js file contains the new code that runs the search.  When the page is loaded, the UFO table is populated with the entire data set.  The user may then use the search box to filter the data by date.  The code "listens" for the button-click and then loads the filtered data.

UFO-level-2 is located in https://github.com/jhurley684/javascript_challenge/edit/main/ufo-level-2/  directory.  This directory contains the app.js with my javascript code, the index.html was adjusted so that there is a input form for each search criteria: date, city, state, country, shape.  To make the search area cleaner and more compact I eliminated the "filter" buttons and just made the search run on "change".  Like in UFO-level-1, when the page is loaded all the data is populated in the table.  At that point, the user can search on any criteria.
